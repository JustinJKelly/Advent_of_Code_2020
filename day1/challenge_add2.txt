Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?
